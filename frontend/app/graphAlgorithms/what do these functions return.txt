Functions in this directory run some graph algorithm for a fixed graph
and return the sequence of operations that should be performed in the visualization
to demonstrate work of this algorithm.

Possible operations:

mark v - makes border of vertex v blue. If there is another marked vertex, it becomes unmarked.
unmark - if there is a marked vertex, make it unmarked.
visit v - makes vertex grey.
unvisit v - makes vertex white.
setInfo v info - assigning a value info to additionalInfo parameter of vertex v. It will be displayed above the vertex.
edge u v color - colors the edge u->v.
edge u v invisible - makes the edge u->v invisible.
delay - makes delay before the next operation.
clear - paints all vertices and edges in default colors. Removes additionalInfo from all vertices.

In these operations v and u are vertex names.
